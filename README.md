## Hi there 👋

⛏️ I am working to improve the lives of scientists and health outcomes for all!

🗿 To do this, I am learning to implement AI-enabled solutions to solve pain points in the research workflow.

🍳 Cooking up two things right now... 

🧪 🖊️ I have a Life Sciences background (PhD, VC and consulting) and I am learning how to implement AI - both using newly-trained models and implementing existing gen-AI (depending on the application)

Interested in connecting with anyone who has an AI-research background and is interested in the LS side of things - or really any kind of shared enthusiasm!
